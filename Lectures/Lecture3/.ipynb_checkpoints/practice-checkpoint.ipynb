    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "- 1 - Build a single RESTful controller against an EF database\n",
    "- 2 - Add pagination to `GetAll`\n",
    "- 3 - Add very simple optional filtering to `GetAll` (`GreaterThan`)\n",
    "- 4 - Add very simple optional sorting to `GetAll` (by a single property)\n",
    "- 5 - Add generic predicate filtering to `GetAll`\n",

    "### 5 Generic predicate filtering\n",
    "To use generic predicates to select entities of our database we need use LINQ dynamically by means of `Expression Trees` [1]. Expression trees allow to build/compose dynamically LINQ objects that can be used to test for example whether to select or not an entity, to order the result of a query, etc.\n",

    "In the following a schematized version of a simple application is presented. In the schema a client is trying to get all the actors from the remote database that are called `Pippo` and which ages are 18. To do so the client first builds a filter expression (**1**) that captures the just mentioned conditions, and then calls (**2**) the remote method `GetAll` to which the just built filter expression (_our predicate_) is passed as a json string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller captures the call request (**3**) and forwards it to the right method (**4**). The method `GetAll` converts the input filter expression to an equivalent version in `Expression Tree`. The converted expression and the rest of the query is then passed to EF (**5**) which takes will take care of selecting the right actors. Once selected, the actors are returned back to the client (**6**). The client, which meanwhile was waiting for a response (**2.1**) receives the actors and saves them for future usages (**7**).\n",
