    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "- 1 - Build a single RESTful controller against an EF database (A)\n",
    "- 2 - Add pagination to `GetAll` (M)\n",
    "- 3 - Add generic predicate filtering to `GetAll` (M)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 Building a RESTful controller and test it with POSTMAN\n",
    "- To start the implementation you need two addtional tools: \n",
    "    - A HTTP client named `Postman` that send and recieve HTTP messages (json) to and from a web API.  Download Postman:(https://www.getpostman.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A .net core package called `Newtonsoft.Json` to serialize json messages and deserialize .NET object. This package will be added after project creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to autmatically generate a controller in dotnet core we will create a `webapi-application`.  Then we add the `model` part to it (see step 3). To setup a webapi-project in a folder called lesson3 excute the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "`dotnet new webapi -o lesson3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the folder of your project type those commands in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json`\n",
    "`dotnet restore`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compile and run this project to check if the web API is working by default. After excuting the run-command `dotnet run` in the console your web API will start working by showing the message: \n",
    "\n",
    "`Now listening on: http://localhost:5000`\n",
    "`Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Step 2: Web API check\n",
