    "In this practicum the functionality of the console application that have been built in practicum 1 and 2 will be extended. We discussed ealier the MVC architecture.  After implementing the `model` part that is resposible for the commuication with the data storage we will add a `controller` part to the application. This controller will serve as a HTTP application programming interface (API). So it is just an object that handles HTTP requests and creates the HTTP response. Any addtional logic that is needed to implement a response will be implmented in the controller. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a single RESTful controller against an EF database\n",
    "- Add pagination to `GetAll`\n",
    "- Add very simple optional filtering to `GetAll` (`GreaterThan`)\n",
    "- Add very simple optional sorting to `GetAll` (by a single property)\n",
    "- Create filtering criteria dynamically by building `Linq expressions`. This criteria will be deserialed from a json message.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0:  Project setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- To start the implementation you need two addtional tools: \n",
    "    - A HTTP client named `Postman` that send and recieve HTTP messages (json) to and from a web API.  Download Postman:(https://www.getpostman.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A .net core package called `Newtonsoft.Json` to serialize json messages and deserialize .NET object. This package will be added after project creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to autmatically generate a controller in dotnet core we will create a `webapi-application`.  Then we add the `model` part to it (see step 3). To setup a webapi-project in a folder called lesson3 excute the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "`dotnet new webapi -o lesson3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the folder of your project type those commands in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json`\n",
    "`dotnet restore`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compile and run this project to check if the web API is working by default. After excuting the run-command `dotnet run` in the console your web API will start working by showing the message: \n",
    "\n",
    "`Now listening on: http://localhost:5000`\n",
    "`Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step 2: Web API check\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default the .net core will generate a controller for you in the root folder. Go to the controller-folder and open the file `ValuesController.cs`. \n",
